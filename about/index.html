			<p id="welcome">Welcome to Suriosity.com, an informal website where I would
			like to tell you a little about myself.</p>


			<p>From the picture and the caption beneath the picture, you'll see what I
			look like and my name. A picture can be worth a thousand words but I would
			like to give you a thousand and two words about myself, so here it is. I am
			a proud Panther, representing FIU; I am a motivated and responsible person,
			always trying to give 110%; I am a curious young man, trying to figure out
			what life is all about and how things work. My ambitions and desires in life
			are simple: I want to be happy most of all, and I want to become an
			acknowledged software developer.</p>


			<p>My interest in computers has been around since I was a young child and
			has cultivated into a passion that I like to sink myself into whenever I
			can. When I was first introduced to programming, I was left stupefied. I was
			flabbergasted at what I could make a computer do; and at that point all I
			had done was make a computer say "Hello World." I enrolled in an "Intro to
			C++" class and learned about the basic terms and concepts in Computer
			Science. I was able to use loops and read files and do much more which
			astounded me at that time. But then I realized that the more I knew, the
			more I didn't know. When given the choice to continue the course and take
			the second level "Objected Oriented Programming with C++", I gladly took it.
			I was intellectually challenged with the once daunting concepts such as
			linked lists and inheritance. Fortunately for me, I had a friend, who become
			a mentor in many ways, and another pal, who I was taking the class with,
			help explain, conceptualize, and soldify the concepts.</p>


			<p>Since then, I've dabbled with HTML/CSS and PHP (which I used to create
			this website), became familiar with the Linux shell, and am now in pursuit
			of understanding another object oriented programming language: Java, which I
			would like to use to create Android applications. In the coming future, I
			know I would like develop iOS apps using Swift, Apple's proprietary
			language, and would also like to learn JavaScript to make my webpages more
			interactive.s</p>


			<p>Besides that, in my free time, I like to enjoy the natural beauty of
			life. Living in Miami has given me no shortage of the ability to do as such.
			I love going to the beach and seeing the never-ending horizon atop the water
			and the awe-inspiring sunsets. I also love to play and watch basketball. My
			favorite team in the NBA is, and always has been the Miami Heat. Besides
			basketball, my friends have also built up my involvement and liking of
			ultimate frisbee.</p>
