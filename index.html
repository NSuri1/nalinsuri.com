				<p id="welcome">Welcome to Suriosity.com, an informal website where I would
				like to tell you a little about myself.</p>


				<p>From the picture and the caption beneath the picture, you'll see what I
				look like and my name. A picture can be worth a thousand words but I would
				like to give you a thousand and two words about myself, so here it is. I am
				a proud Panther, representing FIU; I am a motivated and responsible person,
				always trying to give 110%; I am a curious young man, trying to figure out
				what life is all about and how things work. My ambitions and desires in
				life are simple: I want to be happy most of all, and I want to become an
				acknowledged software developer.</p>


				<p>My interest in computers has been around since I was a young child and
				has cultivated into a passion that I like to sink myself into whenever I
				can. When I was first introduced to programming, I was left stupefied. I
				was flabbergasted at what I could make a computer do; and at that point all
				I had done was make a computer say "Hello World." I enrolled in an "Intro
				to C++" class and learned about the basic terms and concepts in Computer
				Science. I was able to use loops and read files and do much more which
				astounded me at that time. But then I realized that the more I knew, the
				more I didn't know. When given the choice to continue the course and take
				the second level "Objected Oriented Programming with C++", I gladly took
				it. I was intellectually challenged with the once daunting concepts such as
				linked lists and inheritance. Fortunately for me, I had a friend, who
				become a mentor in many ways, and another pal, who I was taking the class
				with, help explain, conceptualize, and soldify the concepts.</p>


				<p>Since then, I've dabbled with HTML/CSS and PHP (which I used to create
				this website), became familiar with the Linux shell, and am now in pursuit
				of understanding another object oriented programming language: Java, which
				I would like to use to create Android applications. In the coming future, I
				know I would like develop iOS apps using Swift, Apple's proprietary
				language, and would also like to learn JavaScript to make my webpages more
				interactive.s</p>


				<p>Besides that, in my free time, I like to enjoy the natural beauty of
				life. Living in Miami has given me no shortage of the ability to do as
				such. I love going to the beach and seeing the never-ending horizon atop
				the water and the awe-inspiring sunsets. I also love to play and watch
				basketball. My favorite team in the NBA is, and always has been the Miami
				Heat. Besides basketball, my friends have also built up my involvement and
				liking of ultimate frisbee.</p>


				<p>In closing, below are links to my Github, where most of my work and
				projects are located, and my LinkedIn profile, where we can connect if
				you'd like. There is also a little section which will allow you to contact
				me if you would like!</p>
